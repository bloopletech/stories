# Heading 1

## Heading 2

This is a test text document, with *both bold* and _italic subsections_.

Here is a hard wrapped paragraph,
with both a second
and a third line in it.

*This paragraph is completely bold.*

_This paragraph is completely italic._

This _paragraph mixes italic *with bold*_.

This *paragraph mixes bold _with italic_*.


This paragrah has an extra blank line above it, and is hard wrapped with
 an indent on subsequent lines. I wonder if the indent has to be
 the same on subsequent lines?

A final paragraph.
